    <div class="inner">
        <p><a href="/">Working Copy</a> is a full featured Git client for iOS. Git is a powerful version-control system and can take some time to master.
            The same is true for Working Copy, and even though you will not need to work with the command-line, some understanding of Git is needed.
            If you are not confident with Git's core concepts you should read the first few chapters of <a target="reference" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> by Scott Chacon or the
            excellent <a target="reference" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">tutorials</a>
            Atlassian has made available.</p>

        <h3 id="cloning-repos">1.1 Cloning repositories</h3>
        <div class="left">
         <img class="animated" src="img/clone-77.jpg" alt="Video showing cloning on phone: User presses + in the upper right corner and picks clone. Picks protocol, types username, hostname and path on the Other tab. Picks repository from list on GitHub tab. Presses Clone to start transfer. When cloning completes the repository contents are shown." />
        </div>
        <p>The first step is to get hold of a local copy of the Git repositories you want to access.
            Duplicating a repository from a remote server is
            known as cloning, and you do this by pressing + on the list of repositories.</p>
        <p>You provide a URL pointing to a repository on the Git remote you wish to clone from.
            Working Copy can transfer data from the remote using http, https or ssh protocols. However, but you should be careful
            using http transfer since data will be sent without encryption, which means your login credentials and your source
            code can be intercepted. If you are not on a trusted network you should avoid using http transfer.</p>
        <p id="hosting-services">Conveniently for BitBucket and GitHub users, you can enter your credentials and get a list of repositories.
            Cloning then amounts to picking the repository and tapping clone. You are not restricted to these Git services.
            If you are using some other Git hosting service or a private server to host your repositories, copy-paste your
            URL into the top field and Working Copy will clone just as well.</p>

    </div><div class="inner">

    <div class="right"><img src="img/css-content-45.png"/></div>
    <h3 id="accessing-files">1.2 Accessing files</h3>
    <p>Data in Working Copy is organized as repositories, containing directories, which themselves contain
        either sub-directories or files.
        Tapping a file shows the file content, the changes to the file and the status of the file.</p>

    <p>File content is shown with syntax highlighting for sourcecode and a preview of html and document files.
        Tap the action-button in the upper-right corner to Edit the file or to send the file to other applications such as Mail.</p>

    <p>The editing inside Working Copy is bare-bones and neutral in that
        neither programming languages, markdown nor regular text
        files get special treatment. If you are performing heavy editing consider using a
        specialized text-editor app for programming, markdown or other purposes.
        You can read <a href="#extending-ios">more</a> about using Working Copy in combination
        with other applications.</p>

</div><div class="inner">

    <h3 id="committing-changes">1.3 Committing changes</h3>
    <div class="left"><img src="img/commit-sheet-32.png"/></div>
    <p>When you have file modifications the Changes tab lights up. You can see what has been added in green and what has
        been deleted in red. If you are satisfied with the changes you can commit
        them to the repository with a button on the Status tab.
        A faster way, however, is to swipe left on the file in the directory listing.
        Swiping left can generally be performed on lists of files,
        directories and repositories allowing convenient access to frequent actions.</p>

    <p>You can commit a single file, multiple files or the entire repository at once, and it is considered good practice to make a
        commit represent one conceptual change to your repository. Following this practice also makes it easier to come up with concise
        yet descriptive commit descriptions.
    </p>

    <p>When you have made one or more commits your on-device repository is seen as being ahead of the remote repository
        and you <em>push</em> these commits to the remote. Because <em>Commit</em> and <em>Push</em> are distinct
        actions you can <em>Commit</em> while offline and <em>Push</em> once you get back online.</p>

</div>
    <div class="inner">

        <h3 id="up-to-date">1.4 Staying up-to-date</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/status-79.jpg"/></div>

        <p>Commits can be pushed to the remote from many sources.
            Other people contribute their work, or you could be doing something
            on a regular computer or another iOS device which results in commits that end up on the remote. You need to unlock
        the ability to <em>Push</em> with an in-app purchase.</p>

        <p>You get commits back into Working Copy through a two-step process where you <em>Fetch</em> and <em>Merge</em>.
            <em>Fetch</em> reads commits from the
            server and requires a network connection. The commits will not be integrated with the local data on your device until
            you <em>Merge</em>, which will combine the new commits from the server with your local data.</p>

        <p>Sometimes data cannot be automatically combined because your local changes conflict with the changes from the commits fetched.
            These conflicts need to be resolved by hand-picking the correct content of the conflicted files and choosing
            <em>Resolve</em> from the action button.</p>

        <p>As a short-hand you can <em>Fetch</em>, <em>Merge</em> and <em>Push</em> a repository with the <em>Sync</em> button
            on the detail screen of your remote.</p>
        <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    </div>
    <h2 id="remotes">2. Remotes</h2>

    <div class="inner">
        <div class="left"><img class="left" src="img/remote-details-81.jpg"/></div>
        <p>Git remotes are server-side duplicates of your repositories with full history.
            These can be services such as GitHub, BitBucket etc. or they can be be privately hosted servers or NAS drives.</p>

        <p>When you clone a repository, the URL of the remote repository is your starting point. Working Copy supports ssh, https and
            http remotes and the URL consists of protocol scheme, the hostname, username and the path to the repository on the host.
            The following are typical examples of remote URLs:</p>

<pre>https://user@git.company.se/home/user/site.git
ssh://andrew@company.se/home/andrew/git/site.git/
andrew@company.se/home/andrew/git/site.git/
</pre>
        <p>The last two URLs are equivalent since ssh is the default protocol.</p>
        <p>If you enter the Repository page you can add or delete remotes. After cloning there is only a single “origin”
            remote and, in many scenarios, there is no need for additional remotes.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="clone-catalog">2.1 Clone catalog</h3>
        <p>When cloning repositories from BitBucket or GitHub you must enter your credentials to get a list of repositories to clone.
            Working Copy tries to show the most relevant repositories at the top, these being the ones where you have administrative
            or write privileges. If the list is long, enter keywords in the search field in order to only see repositories containing these.
            If you do not see the repository you wish to clone, you can still copy-paste the clone URL into the top-field manually.</p>

        <p>Working Copy will not store your BitBucket or GitHub password used to populate the list of remotes,
            but rather as an authentication
            token that you can revoke from the BitBucket or GitHub settings. This is why you are required to login through Safari
            rather than inside Working Copy.</p>

        <p>When actually cloning the repository you cannot use the authentication token for the transfer and will either need to
            configure a SSH authentication key or enter your password inside Working Copy. This password is stored in an encrypted
            keychain maintained by iOS that is only accessible when your phone is unlocked.
            If you are using the two-factor authentication
            the password authentication will not work and you are required to use SSH key authentication for transfer.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="ssh-keys">2.2 SSH keys</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/ssh-config-30.png"/></div>

        <p>SSH transfers support password authentication but also public/private key authentication for improved security.
            The public part of SSH key corresponds to a padlock that you use to lock-down resources. The private part of the SSH
            key corresponds to the physical key that opens the padlock. Your private key must be kept secret and the public key can be
            distributed to servers where you want to store remote repositories.</p>

        <p>If you tap “Connect with BitBucket” or “Connect with GitHub” your public key will automatically be registered with this
            BitBucket or GitHub. For other Git hosting providers such as OpenShift or GitLab you need to enter your public key in
            the settings page for that service. The details will depend upon the service in question, but your first step is to Export the public key.
            When using a Linux server, you need to append the public key to
            $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="ssh-troubleshooting">2.3 SSH Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>If you are having problems authenticating with an SSH server you should make sure the public key installed on the server
            matches the private key in Working Copy. If you have some other SSH client on your device or computer, you should make sure
            you can connect from these without problems. If this works, you must also make sure you use the same SSH key in Working Copy, possibly
            importing the private key from the other application.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A repository is presented as a hierarchy of directories and files where you tap a directory to enter and
            view the contents.
            If you tap a file you are a shown tab for Content with the ability to switch between Preview,
            Syntax Highlighted or Hex Dump modes.
            Use the action button in the upper-right corner to send the file to other apps or to edit inside Working Copy.</p>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/content-mode-89.png"/></div>

        <p>Some repositories have deep directory hierarchies and to avoid having to go back repeatedly, you can tap and hold
            the back button to choose how far back you want to step.</p>

    <div style="clear: both; margin-top: -75px" class="left"><img src="img/image-diff-83.png"/></div>
    <p>A badge on the Changes tab shows the number of lines added or deleted from a file.
        The Changes tab itself shows the differences
        between the last version committed and the current version. You can long-tap changed blocks to recover deleted blocks or
        remove added blocks. The two-panel split-view in the screenshot requires the screen to be wide and for phones to be
        turned to landscape mode.</p>

    <p>Image changes can be viewed in a split-mode where zooming one image will make the other one follow -
        making it easy to focus on the details.
        If you are unsure as to where the changes are in an image, use the Color mode that highlights changed areas. Cut mode is useful for images with
        global changes and allows you to drag and rotate a partitioning line in such a way that everything on one side is the old image.
        The previous image will have a red border, and the new one a green border.</p>

    <p>Files can sometimes be conflicted because there have been changes
        made to the file that could not be automatically merged.
        This will occur when two people work on the same part of a file at once and
        they commit changes without knowing about the other changes made.
        In such cases, you will then need to pick one or the other, or a combined version of the file.
        When you edit the file there are conflict
        markers showing how the two different versions of the file disagree on content.
        You need to sort this out and mark the file as Resolved,
        which can be done with the action button.</p>

    <p>The Status tab says whether the file is modified and allows you to commit or revert changes.
        If you tap edit you can rename or delete the file.</p>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    <h2 id="commit-revert">4. Committing or reverting</h2>
    <div class="inner">
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/commit-sheet-32.png"/></div>

        <p>You can commit changes to your files for the entire repository, for all files in a sub-directory or for a specific file.
            If you do not wish to commit some of your files you can Revert to how they where at the last commit.
            The files taken into account are determined by where in the directory structure you initiate the commit.
            As a short-hand you can swipe left on a repository, directory or file to commit.</p>
        <div class="left"><img class="left" src="img/status-modified-19.png"/></div>

        <p>During commit you are shown a list of changed files and can view differences for individual files by pressing the button
            that shows the number of lines added or deleted. Files with a checkmark will be included in the commit and you toggle the
            checkmark by tapping the file.
            Working Copy will push the commit to the remote right away if you enable the <em>+Push</em> button.</p>

        <p>As a general rule you should make commits with a single purpose and only include the changed files that helped achieve this purpose.
            You should write a message in the top line describing this purpose;
            if it is hard to write something short but concrete you might
            need to break your commit into smaller parts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inner">
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/commit-list-28.png"/></div>

        <h3 id="commit-history">4.1 Commit history</h3>
        <p>The value of well-drafted commit messages becomes apparent when looking at a log of previous commits.
            You may do this for either the entire repository, a directory with all its files or for single files.
            If your commit messages are meaningful, even if you return to a project after months or years you have a much
            better chance of making sense of the source-code.
            Tap a commit to see specific changes this commit made to the files in question.</p>

        <p>The images shown in commit-logs are determined from the email-address of the person making the commit with the
            help of <a target="gravatar" href="http://gravatar.com/">gravatar.com</a>.
            At the commit-list for the entire repository you can Checkout old versions of your
            files by swiping left on a commit. Your repository will be in a “detached head” state where you cannot commit any changes,
            but if you make modifications and wish to keep these, you should create a new branch.
        </p>
        <p>Checking out the topmost commit will reattach the head in such a way that your repository is back to normal.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="branching">4.2 Branches</h3>

        <div class="left"><img class="left" src="img/branch-52.png"/></div>

        <p>A great advantage of Git compared to other version-control software is the ease at which you can branch your
            repository to work independently on different things.
            Once you are confident with the work undertaken in a branch you can merge
            it back to one of your main branches.</p>

        <p>In Working Copy you can do this from the Repository screen by tapping the current
            branch name to access a list of branches
            with the ability to switch to a new branch, create a new branch or merge branches back together.</p>

        <div style="clear: left"></div>
        <h3 id="commit-graph">4.3 Commit Graph</h3>

        <p>To explore repository changes across branches use the Commit Graph available from the Repository screen.</p>
        <p>Commits are presented in chronological order with lines showing which commits are based on each other,
            with tags and branch heads displayed as well as the commit message summary, date and information about the author of the commit.
        </p>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/commit-graph.png"/></div>
        <p>Pinch to zoom will let you explore additional details, such as the full commit message, the full name of the author
            rather than initials, a commit identifier and the files modified by this commit. If you connect an external
        screen or projector to your device, you will get a full-screen Commit Graph without any interface elements
        obscuring the view. This makes for a convenient tool when your team needs to discuss the project.</p>
        <p>You can tap and hold or double-tap the elements of a commit for additional actions.</p>
        <p>The Commit Message lets you activate a share-sheet for the entire commit message, letting you
            copy to clipboard or send in an email. You can also view Details of the commit switching away from
            the Commit Graph.</p>
        <p>You can copy the author email to the clipboard or start composing a email to the author.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to view the commit date in your calendar to see what else happened around this time and
            when <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone" target="fantastical">Fantastical</a> is installed,
            it will be used instead of the built-in Calendar app.</p>
        <p>Finally, the list of modified files lets you generate a Patch, for non-merge Commits.</p>

        <div class="left"><img class="left" src="img/textastic-87.png"/></div>

        <p>Working Copy takes advantage of recent improvements to iOS allowing richer cooperation between applications.
            All repositories in Working Copy can be accessed by other applications using the iCloud document picker.
            Once a file inside Working Copy is picked, the other application is allowed to read and make changes to this file
            and these changes stay inside Working Copy. You can perform editing in this application and switch to
            Working Copy to review and commit changes. On the iPad you can use
            <a target="iPad-guide" href="https://help.apple.com/ipad/9/#/iPad5afb8ee4">Slide Over</a> or
            <a target="iPad-guide" href="https://help.apple.com/ipad/9/#/iPad63ea0cbb">Split View</a>
            to avoid switching between Working Copy and the editing application.</p>

        <p><a target="app" href="http://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a> is a very good general purpose/programmers editor

        <h3 id="saving">5.1 Saving to Working Copy</h3>
        <p>Saving files into Working Copy can be accomplished by way of a Share sheet, the mechanism also used to share files though Mail or Messages.
            Picking Working Copy on a Share sheet will present a list of repositories, where you drill down to the directory where the file should be saved.
            To overwrite existing files you tap a fie before confirming. Otherwise you will be prompted to enter a new file name.</p>

        <p>After saving a file you can optionally <em>Commit</em> this change immediately and <em>Push</em> to the remote right away.</p>

    <h3 id="workflows-callbacks">5.2 Workflows and Callbacks</h3>
    <div class="left"><img class="left" src="img/callback-setup-26.png"/></div>

    <p>Working Copy supports the <a href="/url-schemes.html">x-callback-url</a> mechanism for inter-app coorporation.
        This allows reading and writing files from repositories as
        well as committing changes and pushing commits to your remotes. As a security measure this mechanism needs
        to be enabled from the settings
        page and is protected by a random key.</p>

    <p>By using applications such as
        <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Workflow</a>

        you can achieve some of the power of shell-scripting on iOS by
        combining actions of several applications into one action.</p>

    <div class="inner">
        <h3 id="webdav-server">5.3 WebDAV access</h3>
        <div class="right"><img class="right" src="img/webdav-settings.png"/></div>

        <p>In situations where you need to transfer entire directory hierarchies,
            a good way to get files into and out of Working Copy is the built-in
            <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> server. It is also
            the best way to let
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda-for-ios/id500906297?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Coda</a>
            edit the files in your Git repositories.
        </p>
        <p>As a security precaution you need to start the server before each use and it automatically shuts down
            after five minutes of inactivity. You should be cautious of using the WebDAV server on untrusted
            networks as the transfers are unencrypted. In these cases you should restrict yourself
            to connections from applications on the same device, as the traffic cannot be intercepted when
            it never leaves your device. Local connections are also possible in situations without an Internet
            connection. You need to specify <em>localhost</em> as the hostname in these situations.</p>
        <p>Applications on iOS are restricted as to how long they are allowed to run in the background. If you start
           the WebDAV server and switch to some other application, you will be given a grace period before
            Working Copy and its WebDAV server is terminated and a notification will inform you of this.
        </p>
       <p>On newer iPads running iOS 9, you can use
           <a target="iPad-guide" href="https://help.apple.com/ipad/9/#/iPad63ea0cbb">Split View</a>
           multitasking to keep two applications in the foreground.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using applications such as <a target="app" href="http://www.textasticapp.com">Textastic</a> and
            <a target="app" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit-ios/id917432930?mt=8&amp;at=1000lHq">Transmit</a>
            that can work with both WebDAV and SSH
            servers, you can deploy from a Git repository to a standard Linux server by transferring
            the directory hierarchy from Working Copy into the other application and then from the other
            application onto the server.
            Here you can watch a short <a target="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_EF6TbOEz0">video</a>
